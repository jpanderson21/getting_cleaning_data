Description:
============

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Feature Selection:
==================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (Time-BodyAcc-XYZ and Time-GravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (Time-BodyAccJerk-XYZ and Time-BodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (Time-BodyAccMag, Time-GravityAccMag, Time-BodyAccJerkMag, Time-BodyGyroMag, Time-BodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FFT-BodyAcc-XYZ, FFT-BodyAccJerk-XYZ, FFT-BodyGyro-XYZ, FFT-BodyAccJerkMag, FFT-BodyGyroMag, FFT-BodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'FFT' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Variable Derivation:
====================

The set of variables that were estimated from the signals are: 

* Mean: Mean value
* StdDev: Standard deviation

Each variable was then averaged by activity and subject.
